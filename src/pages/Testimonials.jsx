        As an ex-groomer, I highly recommend Krystal for your fur baby’s needs! My sweet boy Scotch would have bad anxiety, jumping and growling at loud noises, he didn’t even like the water... I called Krystal at my wits end, asking her why it can’t get him to calm down. She told me the same thing we as groomers tell a lot of pet parents. “You’re his mama. Your job is to love him. My job is to groom him, and teach him how to be comfortable with the process.” ... I handed that responsibility over to her. I will never regret that decision. My Scotch’s attitude has changed immensely. It’s been a complete transformation for my fur baby and our family.
